Added JPA repository using HSQL database for data persistence. May 19 2020.

Took four weeks to get a new computer, thanks to COVID. But, it's here: 12GB i7 > 4GB A4. July 2, 2020.

Added View controller class to call index.html file. Added a view, index.html, to template folder. Added Bootstrap dependencies to pom.xml file. 
I don't need to preserve offline functionality so I have been trying to make the project work without using ThymeLeaf file structure and code. 
Might be more useful to just start my own project. August 30, 2020.
